# Explorations in Digital Humanities

 
## Introduction 

This is my Intro to T&T respository using GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio Code. 

## Features 
- Get to know me:  

I am a student in the [Texts and Technology Ph.D.](cah.ucf.edu/textstech) program at the University of Central Florida. Having earned an M.A. in [Journalism and Media Studies](https://cis.ua.edu/departments/jcm/) and an M.F.A. in [Creative Writing](https://cw.english.ua.edu) from the University of Alabama, I study poetry culture, from its history in print syndication to its appearance on social media platforms. I'm also also a freelance print designer, having served as a consultant on experimental poetry and graphic novel collections, as Art & Design Editor for the [*Black Warrior Review*](bwr.ua.edu), and as a Digital Archive Associate with the [*Kenyon Review*](kenyonreview.org). In August 2024, I launched [*reâ€¢mediate*](remediatelitmag.xyz), a critical literary magazine that publishes computer-assisted writing and criticism about it. PD grew up between Managua, Nicaragua and Central Florida, and this experience is at the core of his multimedia and hybrid-genre writing.

- Get to know my work: 
I've published creative writing in [*Ghost Proposal*](https://ghostproposal.com/PD-Edgar) and [*Ekphrastic Review*](https://www.ekphrastic.net/the-ekphrastic-review/at-least-18-photos-of-fish-by-p-d-edgar), among others. 

Academically, I've written and presented about the poetry of *Ms.* Magazine, Instagram Poetry, poetry forms and concrete poetry, Adobe InDesign for creative writers and publishers, literary magazines, ChatGPT's attempts to generate poetry, and so on.
